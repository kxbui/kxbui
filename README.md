### Xin ChÃ o. Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khoi. I am a senior frontend engineer who has strong passion about web framework.

I love writing blogs to help web developers with tips and tricks. You can find all of my blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@khoixbui).

Check out some of my opensource projects:
* [Format js numbers with metric prefix](https://github.com/iresa-org/ngx-metric-prefix)
* [Image rendering utilities](https://github.com/iresa-org/ngx-imagely)
* [Custom Music Playlist App](https://github.com/iresa-org/iresa-web-portal)
